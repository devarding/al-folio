                    <p>Aerosols are mainly situated within the planetary boundary layer (PBL), affecting radiation, atmospheric stability, clouds, and precipitation. Aerosols, the PBL, and clouds may be coupled, influencing each other’s development and further influencing meteorology and the atmospheric environment. The impacts and their interactions may be significant enough to affect weather and climate, depending on their states and coupling relationships. This study aims at understanding the fundamental processes governing the interactions between boundary-layer clouds and aerosols. By examining the development of boundary-layer clouds and aerosol transport in the context of surface-cloud coupling, we attempt to advance the understanding of their impacts on the development of convective clouds. To this end, we have developed algorithms for identifying the PBL height and cloud-surface coupling and have used them to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of aerosol-PBL-cloud coupling and their interactions, furthering our understanding of their joint effects on the development of convective clouds and air quality.

                    <p>Due to surface heating, the morning boundary layer transits from stable to neutral or convective conditions, exerting critical influences on low tropospheric thermodynamics. Low clouds closely interact with the boundary layer development, yet their interactions bear considerable uncertainties. Our study reveals that cloud-surface coupling alters the morning transition from stable to unstable boundary layer and thus notably affects the diurnal variation of the boundary layer. Specifically, due to the reduction in surface fluxes, decoupled clouds can delay the process of eroding nocturnal inversion by 0.8-hr and even prevent the transition of the boundary layer from happening for 12% of decoupled cases, keeping the boundary layer in a stable state during the noontime. On the other hand, when clouds are coupled with the surface, cloud-top radiative cooling can directly cool the upper boundary layer to facilitate sub-cloud convection, leading to an unstable boundary layer in the earlier morning.

                    <p>Black-carbon (BC) aerosol can strongly influence planetary boundary layer (PBL) development and thus severe haze formation, but its distinct role compared with scattering aerosols is not yet fully understood. Here, combining numerical simulation and field observation, we found a “tipping point,” where the daily maximum PBL height decreases abruptly when exceeding a critical threshold of aerosol optical depth (AOD), due to a BC-induced decoupling of mixing zones. Because the threshold AOD decreases with increasing BC mass fraction, our results suggest that the abrupt transition of PBL development to adverse conditions can be avoided by reducing the AOD below the threshold but can be avoided more efficiently by reducing the BC mass fraction to increase the threshold (e.g., up to four to six times more effective in extreme haze events in Beijing). To achieve co-benefits for air quality and climate change, our findings clearly demonstrate that high priority should be given to controlling BC emissions.

                    <p>Aerosol-boundary layer interactions play an important role in affecting atmospheric thermodynamics and air pollution. As a key factor in dictating the development of the boundary layer, the entrainment process in the context of aerosol-boundary layer interactions is still poorly understood. Using comprehensive field observations made at a superstation in Beijing, we gain insight into the response of the entrainment process to aerosols. We found that high aerosol loading can significantly suppress the entrainment rate, breaking the conventional linear relationship between sensible heat fluxes and entrainment fluxes. Related to aerosol vertical distributions, aerosol heating effects can alter vertical heat fluxes, leading to a strong interaction between aerosols and the entrainment process in the upper boundary layer. Such aerosol-entrainment coupling can inhibit boundary layer development and explains the great sensitivity of observed entrainment rates to aerosols than can traditional calculations. The notable impact of aerosols on the entrainment process raises holistic thinking about the dynamic framework of the boundary layer in a polluted atmosphere, which may have a significant bearing on the dispersion of air pollutants and the land-atmosphere coupling.

                    <p>The scattering of light by aerosol particles dictates atmospheric visibility, which is a straightforward indicator of air quality. It is affected by numerous factors, such as particle number size distribution, particle mass concentration (PM2.5), ambient relative humidity (RH), and chemical composition. The latter two factors jointly influence the aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). Here, the particle backscattering coefficient (βp) under ambient RH conditions is investigated to differentiate and quantify the contributions of aerosol properties and meteorology using comprehensive observational datasets acquired at three megacities in China, that is, Beijing (BJ), Nanjing (NJ), and Guangzhou (GZ). Overall, the temporal variations in βp under ambient RH conditions are consistent with those in ALWC at the three sites. The PM2.5 in BJ is systematically higher than in NJ and GZ, while ambient RH and aerosol hygroscopicity in NJ are much higher than in BJ and GZ. Notable differences in the variations of βp with related factors at the three sites are demonstrated. βp is more sensitive to particle hygroscopicity and mass in NJ and ambient RH in BJ. The relative contributions of these factors to βp at the three sites under different pollution conditions are differentiated and quantified. The factor with the largest impact on the variability in βp shifts from particle mass to ambient RH as air quality deteriorated to heavy pollution in BJ. The opposite is true in NJ. In GZ, the contributions of these factors to changes in βp under different pollution conditions are similar, both dominated by PM2.5.

                    <p>This study investigates the impact of aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and related factors, i.e., relative humidity (RH), aerosol mass concentration (PM2.5), and aerosol hygroscopicity, on aerosol optical properties, based on field measurements made in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China at the surface (1 November 2019 to 21 January 2020) and in the upper boundary layer (the 532-m Guangzhou tower from 1 February to 21 March 2020). In general, temporal variations in the ambient aerosol backscattering coefficient (βp) and ALWC followed each other. However, the surface βp and 532-m βp had generally opposite diurnal variation patterns, caused by dramatic differences in PM2.5 and ambient RH between the surface and the upper boundary layer. The ambient 532-m RH was systematically higher than the surface RH, with the latter having a much pronounced diurnal cycle than the former. The surface PM2.5 concentration was systematically higher than the PM2.5 concentration at 532 m, and their diurnal cycle patterns were overall opposite. These dramatic differences reveal that the atmospheric variables, i.e., ambient RH and the PM2.5 concentration in the upper boundary layer, cannot be directly represented by the same variables at the surface. Vertical variability should be considered. Clear differences in the sensitivities of aerosol light scattering to ambient RH, PM2.5, and aerosol hygroscopicity between the two levels were found and examined. Aerosol chemical composition played a minor role in causing the differences between the two levels. In particular, βp was more sensitive to PM2.5 at the surface level but more to the ambient RH in the upper boundary layer. The larger contribution of aerosol loading to the variability in βp at the surface implies that local emission controls can decrease βp and further improve atmospheric visibility effectively at the surface during winter in the PRD region.

                    <p>We explore the decoupling physics of a stratocumulus-topped boundary layer (STBL) moving over cooler water, a situation mimicking warm-air advection (WADV). We simulate an initially well-mixed STBL over a doubly periodic domain with the sea surface temperature decreasing linearly over time using the System for Atmospheric Modeling large-eddy model. Due to the surface cooling, the STBL becomes increasingly stably stratified, manifested as a near-surface temperature inversion topped by a well-mixed cloud-containing layer. Unlike the stably stratified STBL in cold-air advection (CADV) that is characterized by cumulus coupling, the stratocumulus deck in the WADV is unambiguously decoupled from the sea surface, manifested as weakly negative buoyancy flux throughout the subcloud layer. Without the influxes of buoyancy from the surface, the convective circulation in the well-mixed cloud-containing layer is driven by cloud-top radiative cooling. In such a regime, the downdrafts propel the circulation, in contrast to that in CADV regime for which the cumulus updrafts play a more determinant role. Such a contrast in convection regime explains the difference in many aspects of the STBLs including the entrainment rate, cloud homogeneity, vertical exchanges of heat and moisture, and lifetime of the stratocumulus deck, with the last being subject to a more thorough investigation in Part II. Finally, we investigate under what conditions a secondary stratus near the surface (or fog) can form in the WADV. We found that weaker subsidence favors the formation of fog whereas a more rapid surface cooling rate does not.

                    <p>The planetary boundary layer (PBL) governs the vertical transport of mass, momentum, and moisture between the surface and the free atmosphere, and thus the determination of PBL height (BLH) is recognized as crucial for air quality, weather, and climate analysis. Although reanalysis products can provide important insight into the global view of BLH in a seamless way, the BLH observed in situ on a global scale remains poorly understood due to the lack of high-resolution (1 or 2 s) radiosonde measurements. The present study attempts to establish a near-global BLH climatology at synoptic times (00:00 and 12:00 UTC) and in the daytime using high-resolution radiosonde measurements over 300 radiosonde sites worldwide for the period 2012 to 2019, which is then compared against the BLHs obtained from four reanalysis datasets, including ERA5, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NCEP-2. The variations in daytime BLH exhibit large spatial and temporal dependence, and as a result the BLH maxima are generally discerned over the regions such as the western United States and western China, in which the balloon launch times mostly correspond to the afternoon. The diurnal variations in BLH are revealed with a peak at 17:00 local solar time (LST). The most promising reanalysis product is ERA5, which underestimates BLH by around 130 m as compared to radiosondes released during daytime. In addition, MERRA-2 is a well-established product and has an underestimation of around 160 m. JRA-55 and NCEP-2 might produce considerable additional uncertainties, with a much larger underestimation of up to 400 m. The largest bias in the reanalysis data appears over the western United States and western China, and it might be attributed to the maximal BLH in the afternoon when the PBL has risen. Statistical analyses further indicate that the biases of reanalysis BLH products are positively associated with orographic complexity, as well as the occurrence of static instability. To our best knowledge, this study presents the first near-global view of high-resolution radiosonde-derived boundary layer height and provides a quantitative assessment of the four frequently used reanalysis products.

                    <p>Respirable particles with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 10 µm (PM10) have important impacts on the atmospheric environment and human health. Available PM10 datasets have coarse spatial resolutions, limiting their applications, especially at the city level. A tree-based ensemble learning model, which accounts for spatiotemporal information (i.e., space-time extremely randomized trees, denoted as the STET model), is designed to estimate near-surface PM10 concentrations. The 1-km resolution Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol product and auxiliary factors, including meteorology, land-use cover, surface elevation, population distribution, and pollutant emissions, are used in the STET model to generate the high-resolution (1 km) and high-quality PM10 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM10) from 2015 to 2019. The product has an out-of-sample (out-of-station) cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) of 0.86 (0.82) and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 24.28 (27.07) μg/m3, outperforming most widely used models from previous related studies. High levels of PM10 concentration occurred in northwest China (e.g., the Tarim Basin) and the Northern China Plain. Overall, PM10 concentrations had a significant declining trend of 5.81 μg/m3 per year (p < 0.001) over the past five years in China, especially in three key urban agglomerations. The ChinaHighPM10 dataset is potentially useful for future small- and medium-scale air pollution studies by virtue of its higher spatial resolution and overall accuracy.</p>
